name:                edit-distance-vector
version:             1.0.0.4
synopsis:            Calculate edit distances and edit scripts between vectors.
description:
  An implementation of the Wagnerâ€“Fischer dynamic programming algorithm to
  find the optimal edit script and cost between two sequences.
  .
  The implementation in this package is specialised to sequences represented
  with "Data.Vector" but is otherwise agnostic to:
  .
  * The type of values in the vectors;
  .
  * The type representing edit operations; and
  .
  * The type representing the cost of operations.
