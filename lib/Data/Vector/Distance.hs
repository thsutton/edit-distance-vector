-- | Description: Calculate differences between vectors.
--
-- This module implements a variation on the
-- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner–Fischer_algorithm Wagner-Fischer>
-- algorithm to find the shortest sequences of operations which transforms
-- one vector of values into another.

-- | Operations invoked by the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.
--
--   The parameters to this type are as follows:
--
--   * 'v' is the type of values being compared,
--   * 'o' is the type representing operations,
--   * 'c' is the type representing costs.
--
--   The chief restrictions on these type parameters is that the cost type 'c' 
--   must have instances of 'Monoid' and 'Ord'. A good default choice might be
--   the type @('Sum' 'Int')@.
data Params v o c = Params
    { equivalent     :: v -> v -> Bool
    -- ^ Are two values equivalent?
    , delete         :: Int -> v -> o
    -- ^ Delete the element at an index.
    , insert         :: Int -> v -> o
    -- ^ Insert an element at an index.
    , substitute     :: Int -> v -> v -> o
    -- ^ Substitute an element at an index.
    , cost           :: o -> c
    -- ^ Cost of a change.
    , positionOffset :: o -> Int
    -- ^ Positions to advance after a change. E.g. @0@ for a deletion.

-- | Matrix of optimal edit scripts and costs for all prefixes of two vectors.
--
--   This is a representation of the @n * m@ dynamic programming matrix
--   constructed by the algorithm.  The matrix is stored in a 'Vector' in
--   row-major format with an additional row and column corresponding to the
--   empty prefix of the source and destination 'Vectors'.

--   This is a fairly direct implementation of Wagner-Fischer algorithm using
--   the 'Vector' data-type. The 'ChangeMatrix' is constructed in a single-pass.

--   Note: The change matrix is \"raw\" in that the edit script in each cell is
--   in reverse order and uses 'Maybe' to allow for steps at which no change is
--   necessary.
